### Author: Tina Huang

This project performs simple linear regression, as well as multiple linear regression, on variables from the Advertising.csv dataset, to analyze the effect of TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets on overall Sales. 

The code folder contains the scripts for this analysis in the scripts folder. In addition, the code folder contains a function and tests folder to test various regression functions. The data folder contains the Advertising.csv dataset, as well as intermediate output from running the scripts. The images folder contains the plots generated by running the regression scripts. Lastly the report folder contains the rmd version of the report, as well as the final pdf version.

>
> Run `make data` in the console to obtain the Advertising.csv dataset
>
> Run `make` to execute the regression scripts and generate the final report pdf
